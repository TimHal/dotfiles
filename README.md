# dotfiles
Collection of dotfiles and configs


# Usage

### Glance

Place config in ~/.config/glance and mount to /app/config in the glance docker-compose

### i3 / sway

Use to override default i3 config. Sway is the wayland-compatible i3 tiling wm (and xserver?)

Long story short: For Ubuntu 26.04 Resolute Raccoon this is required as i3 alternative, as it uses wayland. 

Install:
  - volumeicon (for i3-setup)


### qutebrowser

Important: make sure to install from source, not the outdated versions that float around apt and co.
